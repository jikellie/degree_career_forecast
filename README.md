# Job availability based on degree - Time series analysis + forecast

Goal was to create a website which listed jobs that were available based on what degree you did. From that each job would have data regarding daily postings for that job, and over a certain time frame. 
From this would then allow for time series analysis and forecast of job opportunities based on degree. 
Job postings per job were webscraped daily from Australian website Indeed, this was then connected to the degrees usually required for these jobs.
